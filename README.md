The goal of minishell is to create a fun little program that lets users interact with their operating system by running commands and managing processes. It comes with features like executing external commands, handling built-in shell commands, managing environment variables, and dealing with input/output redirection.

Minishell works by reading commands from the user, breaking them down, and running them using various system calls and functions. It supports basic shell features such as command execution, argument parsing, signal handling, and environment management.
